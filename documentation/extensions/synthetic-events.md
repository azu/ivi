# Synthetic Events Extensions

Synthetic Events subsystem provides an **experimental** API for building your own `EventDispatcher`.

There are no documentation at this time. Looking at the source code should help understand its architecture. It is
pretty simple and flexible, but there is a high chance that API will be changed in the future.

If you are planning to work on some extensions, make sure that you let us know about that. We can change
`EventDispatcher` API, so that it is working in the best possible way to solve your use cases without any workarounds.
