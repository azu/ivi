# Synthetic Events

Synthetic Events subsystem provides an **experimental** API for building your own `EventDispatcher`.

There are no documentation at this time, looking at the source code should help understand its architecture. It is
pretty simple and flexible, but there is a high chance that API will be changed in the future.
