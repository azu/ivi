# Synthetic Events

Synthetic Events subsystem provides an **experimental** API for building your own `EventDispatcher`.

One of the upcoming features will be cross-browser support for [pointer events](https://www.w3.org/TR/pointerevents/)
and custom gesture events, implemented as an extension on top of this API.
